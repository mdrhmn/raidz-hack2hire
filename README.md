### Problem Statement

The **IT Development Program (ITDP)** is a 2-year global program for our recent full-time college hires. In the program, there are a variety of events such as social hangouts, trainings, volunteer opportunities, etc. 

The regional program managers have tried a variety of solutions to track the progress of participants in the program and post sign-ups for the types of events listed above. 

ITDPs (program participants) want to know their status in the program (trainings completed, events attended) and need an easy way to sign-up for new events. 

**Create a user-friendly solution that helps us address the needs of the IT Development Program PMs and participants.**

### ITDP Personas

There are 3 types of ITDP personas/stakeholders to consider:

1. ITDP Participant
